    I started off at SEEMiS as a fresh faced graduate, just out of university. In my time here I have honed my skills with a variety of technologies while also gaining confidence in my abilities as a developer and beyond (!!!!!TODOO). 
    
    This role consists of developing and supporting Management Information Systems used in the education sector by all 32 of the Scottish Councils. 
    
    Over the years my role in the organisation has expanded as my knowledge and experience have been proven. I wear a lot of hats which go beyond what is described in my job title/description. 

    I am a strong believer in automation of tasks to improve speed and reliablity of taks. 

    I have been extensively involed in improving our VM provisioning process (kickstart / bash) to XXX

    I have brought in a continuous integration envioronment (using jenkins) to provide us with a platform to perform automated tests/metrics/deployments to improve our software development process. 

    (DEV-OPS)

    Something about applicatioon performance troubleshooting and tuning(AppDynamics, SQL Server)

    Designing solutions to improve resiliance

    *NOTE* - I work with our product architect (who in reality is more of a enterprise architect role) 

    My main responsibilities have grown over time, they now include : 
    
    - Full software development cycle involving clients and teams of developers, from requirements capture all the way through to delivery. The development environment consists of Eclipse, JUnit, Ant, Hudson and CVS. 
    - Database design, implementation and optimization. The main database has always been Microsoft SQL Server, but MySQL has been used for a select few projects.
    - Producing deliverable specifications from requirements which can be implemented by other developers.
    - Testing of software; both during development and final integration testing using both manual and JUnit methods. This includes production of test plans for integration testing by other developers and client support team prior to deployment. 
    - Presentation of developments to Client Support Team and clients in a non-technical manner. 
    - Planning time using Scrum methodology to meet deadlines. 
    - Mentor and advise other developers where required. 
    - Production of technically focused documentation for new and existing systems. 
    - Working with external organisations on projects such as data feeds. 
    - Working with the Infrastructure team on new projects and resolving issues. 
    - Configuration of application servers in a scripted and reproducible way.

    For many years my role also included providing third tier helpdesk support, but as the structure of the organisation has evolved this is now handled by a dedicated team, and I only become involved in circumstances that require my specialised knowledge and experience
     
    During my time here I have worked with a number of frameworks, both legacy and current. Server frameworks I have used include Spring, JDBC, EJB, RMI and various flavours of web services (RPC, SOAP and REST). User interface development has mostly been in Swing, but I have also had experience with JSP / servlets, HTML / Javascript and Echo2. Many open source products have been used in the solutions such as iText, JasperReports, SwingX and JXL, some which required fixes to be contributed.
