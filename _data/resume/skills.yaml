    Through my time doing professional, academic, and hobbyist software development I have worked with a wide selection of software technologies. I enjoy learning new technologies as required to solve problems and try to keep up to date with both new technology and industry developments.

    Outside of the self-driven research & development I do which is related to the technologies used in my day-to-day work, I also dabble in IoT, home automation and some web development. I, somewhat infrequently, write a blog detailing solutions that I could not find good material on. Some of this research & development ends up feeding back in to solutions to problems faced in my day-to-day work, or takes the form of proposals for improved tools & technologies.

    I am used to delving into the internals of open source libraries to reverse engineer why something works the way it does, and provide feedback (or fixes) to issues I encounter.
