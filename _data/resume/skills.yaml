    Through my time doing professional, academic, and hobbyist software development I have worked with a wide selection of software technologies. I enjoy learning new technologies as required to solve problems and try to keep up to date with both new technology and industry developments.
        
    In addition to the technologies I have listed as part of my day to day work, I also have past experience using: JAX-WS, JAX-B, Java EE, MicroProfile, Glassfish, Payara, JBoss, ApacheDS, Axis 1.4 (with WSS4J), TypeScript, Angular, Docker, PHP, HTML, CSS (with SCSS/LESS), Jekyll, Ruby and Python.
